```

### 3. Make the script executable and link it globally

```bash
chmod +x tracker.py
ln -s $(pwd)/tracker.py ~/bin/tracker
```

### 4. Add ~/bin to your system $PATH (if not already)

In your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile), add:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

```bash
tracker
```

‚Ä¶from any directory to launch the app.

### Inside the app

- Navigate menus using arrow keys
- Press `q` at any prompt to cancel or return
- All data is saved to `work_log.csv` in the project folder (not committed to Git)

### Notes

- You can categorize entries (e.g., Personal, Client, Freelance)
- Easily extendable with filters, exports, time-based summaries, or SQLite
- Designed for minimalism and utility ‚Äî a clean daily-use CLI

### Future Ideas (Optional Extensions)

- `--help` flag with CLI argument support
- Weekly/monthly summary views
- Tagging and search
- CSV export filters or markdown reports

Let me know if you want to add support for a `--help` flag or command-line arguments down the line.
